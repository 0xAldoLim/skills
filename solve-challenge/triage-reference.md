# Detailed category triage and techniques

Read only sections matching current evidence. The instance boundary in [scope](../docs/SCOPE.md) applies to every historical example. Historical endpoints are evidence, never new authorized targets.

## Flag Formats

Flags vary by CTF. Common formats:
- `flag{...}`, `FLAG{...}`, `CTF{...}`, `TEAM{...}`
- Custom prefixes: check the challenge description or CTF rules for the format (e.g., `ENO{...}`, `HTB{...}`, `picoCTF{...}`)
- Sometimes just a plaintext string with no wrapper

**Validation rule (important):**
- If you find multiple flag-like strings, treat them as candidates and validate before finalizing.
- Prefer the token tied to the intended artifact/workflow (not random metadata noise or obvious decoys).
- Do a corpus-wide uniqueness check and include the source file/path when reporting.

```bash
# Search for common flag patterns in files
grep -rniE '(flag|ctf|eno|htb|pico)\{' .
# Search in binary/memory output
strings output.bin | grep -iE '\{.*\}'
```
