# Detailed category triage and techniques

> Execution guard: historical examples are knowledge, not target authorization. Instance-only scope, bounded requests, local isolation and version checks in ../docs/SCOPE.md and ../docs/WORKFLOW.md take precedence. Never execute recovered malware or model/pickle payloads on the host.

Read only sections matching current evidence. The instance boundary in [scope](../docs/SCOPE.md) applies to every historical example. Historical endpoints are evidence, never new authorized targets.

## First-Pass Workflow

1. Identify the real boundary: browser only, backend only, mixed app, or auth flow.
2. Capture one normal request/response pair for every major feature before fuzzing.
3. Enumerate hidden functionality from JS bundles, response headers, routes, and alternate methods.
4. Classify the likely bug family: injection, authz, parser mismatch, upload, trust proxy, state machine, or client-side execution.
5. Build the smallest proof first: leak, bypass, or primitive. Save full exploit chaining for later.

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Recon
curl -sI https://target.com
ffuf -u https://target.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt
curl -s https://target.com/robots.txt

# SQLi quick test
sqlmap -u "https://target.com/page?id=1" --batch --dbs

# JWT decode (no verification)
echo '<token>' | cut -d. -f2 | base64 -d 2>/dev/null | jq .

# Cookie decode (Flask)
flask-unsign --decode --cookie '<cookie>'
flask-unsign --unsign --cookie '<cookie>' --wordlist rockyou.txt

# SSTI probes
curl "https://target.com/page?name={{7*7}}"
curl "https://target.com/page?name={{config}}"

# Request inspection
curl -v -X POST https://target.com/api -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

## First Questions to Answer

- Is the flag likely in the browser, an API response, a local file, a database row, or an internal service?
- Does the app trust user-controlled data in templates, redirects, file paths, headers, serialized objects, or background jobs?
- Are there multiple parsers disagreeing with each other: proxy vs app, URL parser vs fetcher, sanitizer vs browser, serializer vs filter?
- Can you turn the bug into a smaller primitive first: read one file, forge one token, call one internal endpoint, trigger one bot visit?

## High-Value Recon Checks

- Read the HTML, inline scripts, and bundled JS before guessing the API surface.
- Compare what the UI submits with what the backend accepts; optional JSON fields often unlock hidden paths.
- Check obvious metadata and helper paths early: `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/.well-known/`, `/admin`, `/debug`, `/.git/`, `/.env`.
- Try alternate verbs and content types on interesting routes: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `TRACE`, JSON, form, multipart, XML.
- Treat file upload, PDF/export, webhook, OAuth callback, and admin bot features as likely exploit multipliers.

## Fast Pattern Map

- SQL errors, odd filtering, or state-dependent DB behavior: start with [sql-injection.md](sql-injection.md).
- Templating, file reads, SSRF, command execution, XML, or parser bugs: start with [server-side.md](server-side.md) and [server-side-exec.md](server-side-exec.md).
- XSS, CSP bypass, admin bot, client routing, DOM issues, or scriptless exfiltration: start with [client-side.md](client-side.md).
- Session forgery, hidden admin routes, JWT, OAuth, SAML, or weak trust boundaries: start with [auth-and-access.md](auth-and-access.md), [auth-jwt.md](auth-jwt.md), and [auth-infra.md](auth-infra.md).
- Node.js apps, prototype pollution, VM sandboxes, or SSRF into internal services: add [node-and-prototype.md](node-and-prototype.md).
- Smart contract frontends or blockchain-integrated apps: add [web3.md](web3.md).

## Common Chain Shapes

- Recon -> hidden route -> auth bypass -> internal file read -> token or flag
- XSS or HTML injection -> admin bot -> privileged action -> secret leak
- Traversal or upload -> config/source leak -> secret recovery -> session forgery
- SSRF -> metadata or internal API -> credential leak -> code execution
- SQLi or NoSQL injection -> credential bypass -> second-stage template or upload abuse

## Deep-Dive Notes

Use [field-notes.md](field-notes.md) once you have confirmed the challenge is truly web-heavy and you need the long exploit catalog.

- Recon, SQLi, XSS, traversal, JWT, SSTI, SSRF, XXE, and command injection quick notes
- Deserialization, race conditions, file upload to RCE, and multi-stage chain examples
- Node, OAuth/SAML, CI/CD, Web3, bot abuse, CSP bypasses, and modern browser tricks
- CVE-shaped playbooks and older challenge patterns that still show up in modern CTFs

## Common Flag Locations

- Files: `/flag.txt`, `/flag`, `/app/flag.txt`, `/home/*/flag*`
- Environment: `/proc/self/environ`, process command line, debug config dumps
- Database: tables named `flag`, `flags`, `secret`, or seeded challenge content
- HTTP: custom headers, archived responses, hidden routes, admin exports
- Browser: hidden DOM nodes, `data-*` attributes, inline state objects, source maps
